#DSBN Skills Challenge, Banking System
Every year, the District School Board of Niagara hosts a coding competition that evaluates ability to design, implement, and organize code. This years challenge was to implement an automated ATM banking system. Once the project is created, it was presented to judges and presentation skills were evaluted. I placed 2nd out of 30 [competitors](http://teched.dsbn.org/skills/2016-challenges/2016-results).
